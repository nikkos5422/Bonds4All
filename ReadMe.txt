Company Bonds4All was chosen by the state Department of Finance to serve as a broker selling
government-issued bonds.

Client can apply for a bond by providing his personal data, term and amount.
- Default bond coupon (interest rate) is 5% per year and minimal term is 5 years.

- The application follows regulations that have to be validated in order to preserve fair competition and
to prevent potentially illegal operations. A bond can’t be sold if:
    - the application is made between 10:00 PM and 06:00 AM with an amount higher than 1000
    - reached max number of sold bonds (e.g. 5) per day from a single IP address

- The bond is sold if there are no violations of the regulatory requirements. The newly sold bond
reference is returned to the client, otherwise the client receives a rejection message.

- Client should be able to adjust the term of his bond. Each term extension results in coupon
decreased by 10% of its value. Shortening the term doesn’t affect the coupon.

- Client should be able to retrieve whole history of his bonds, including adjustments.
